	abstract = {Importance: Retinoblastoma (Rb) is one of the first tumors to have a known genetic etiology. However, because biopsy of this tumor is contraindicated, it has not been possible to define the effects of secondary genetic changes on the disease course.
Objective: To investigate whether the aqueous humor (AH) of Rb eyes has sufficient tumor-derived DNA to perform genetic analysis of the tumor, including DNA copy number alterations.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This investigation was a case series study at a tertiary care hospital (Children's Hospital Los Angeles) with a large Rb treatment center. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was isolated from 6 AH samples from 3 children with Rb, including 2 after primary enucleation and 1 undergoing multiple intravitreous injections of melphalan for vitreous seeding. Samples were taken between December 2014 and September 2015.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Measurable levels of nucleic acids in the AH and identification of tumor-derived DNA copy number variation in the AH. The AH was analyzed for DNA, RNA, and micro-RNA using Qubit high-sensitivity kits. Cell-free DNA was isolated from the AH, and sequencing library protocols were optimized. Shallow whole-genome sequencing was performed on an Illumina platform, followed by genome-wide chromosomal copy number variation profiling to assess the presence of tumor DNA fractions in the AH cfDNA of the 3 patients. One child's cfDNA from the AH and tumor DNA were subjected to Sanger sequencing to isolate the RB1 mutation.
Results: Six AH samples were obtained from 3 Rb eyes in 3 children (2 male and 1 female; diagnosed at ages 7, 20, and 28 months). A corroborative pattern between the chromosomal copy number variation profiles of the AH cfDNA and tumor-derived DNA from the enucleated samples was identified. In addition, a nonsense RB1 mutation (Lys→STOP) from 1 child was also identified from the AH samples obtained during intravitreous injection of melphalan, which matched the tumor sample postsecondary enucleation. Sanger sequencing of the AH cfDNA and tumor DNA with polymerase chain reaction primers targeting RB1 gene c.1075A demonstrated this same RB1 mutation.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this study evaluating nucleic acids in the AH from Rb eyes undergoing salvage therapy with intravitreous injection of melphalan, the results suggest that the AH can serve as a surrogate tumor biopsy when Rb tumor tissue is not available. This novel method will allow for analyses of tumor-derived DNA in Rb eyes undergoing salvage therapy that have not been enucleated.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The goal of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of coupling the indirect ophthalmoscope laser delivery system with the 690 nm wavelength diode laser used to perform photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of retinoblastoma.
METHODS: For phase 1, a total of six pigmented rabbits were treated with the indirect laser delivery system. The laser source was provided by the Lumenis Opal 690 nm laser unit, delivered through a 810 nm Indirect ophthalmoscope headpiece and a hand-held 28-diopter indirect lens (1.0 mm spot size). Four rabbits received intravenous verteporfin at doses of 0.43 or 0.86 mg/kg, and two rabbits did not receive verteporfin (controls). A second phase of the study involved eight rabbits using a retinoblastoma xenograft to determine the effect of indirect PDT on subretinal tumors.
RESULTS: For phase 1, a total of 20 laser treatments were performed in the right eyes of six rabbits. Laser power levels ranged between 40 and 150 mW/cm(2) and treatment duration ranged between 1 and 3 min. In the four rabbits that received verteporfin, focal retinal scars were noted at 40 mW/cm(2) and higher power levels. In the two control rabbits that did not receive verteporfin, thermal burns were confirmed at 75 mW/cm(2) and higher power levels. Histopathology showed focal retino-choroidal scars at the site of PDT treatment, without evidence of generalized ocular damage. Using the retinoblastoma xenograft, the indirect PDT system was shown to cause areas of tumor necrosis on histopathology.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pre-clinical study suggest verteporfin may be activated in the rabbit retina with the indirect delivery system and the 690 nm laser unit (i.e., Indirect PDT). Using verteporfin, treatment effects were observed at 40-50 mW/cm(2) in the rabbit retina, while photocoagulation was achieved at 75 mW/cm(2) and higher power levels. Fundoscopic and histopathologic examination of treated areas showed circumscribed areas of retinal damage and a lack of generalized ocular toxicity, suggesting that this modality may represent a safe and localized method for treating intraocular retinoblastoma.},
